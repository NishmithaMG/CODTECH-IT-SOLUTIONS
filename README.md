1.Overview of the Simple Calculator Project
The Simple Calculator is a basic Java console-based application designed to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers entered by the user. It uses the Scanner class to take user input and the switch statement to perform the desired operation.

Key Features
User Input:

Prompts the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2).
Accepts a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /) to perform on the input numbers.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/), with a check to prevent division by zero.
Error Handling:

Handles invalid operations with a default case.
Prevents division by zero by displaying an error message and exiting gracefully.
Includes a catch block for handling arithmetic exceptions, although not strictly necessary for this simple calculator.
Result Display:

Outputs the calculated result for the chosen operation.

2.Overview of the Student Grade Tracker Project
The Student Grade Tracker is a Java-based console application designed to help users input multiple subjects and their corresponding grades, calculate the average grade, and determine the final letter grade based on the average.

Key Features
Subject and Grade Input:

Users can input multiple subjects and their respective marks.
Marks are stored in a HashMap where the key is the subject name and the value is the grade.
Dynamic Input Handling:

Users can input an arbitrary number of subjects until they type done to finish.
Average Calculation:

Computes the average of all grades entered.
Grade Classification:

Converts the average into a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on predefined thresholds.
Error Handling:

Handles cases where no grades are entered and exits gracefully with an appropriate message.
Output Summary:

Displays the calculated average and corresponding letter grade.

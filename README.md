Overview of the Simple Calculator Project
The Simple Calculator is a basic Java console-based application designed to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers entered by the user. It uses the Scanner class to take user input and the switch statement to perform the desired operation.

Key Features
User Input:

Prompts the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2).
Accepts a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /) to perform on the input numbers.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/), with a check to prevent division by zero.
Error Handling:

Handles invalid operations with a default case.
Prevents division by zero by displaying an error message and exiting gracefully.
Includes a catch block for handling arithmetic exceptions, although not strictly necessary for this simple calculator.
Result Display:

Outputs the calculated result for the chosen operation.
